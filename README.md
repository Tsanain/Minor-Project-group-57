College Prediction System

â€¢	Students seek help from many sources such as online sites or professional professionals to find the best options for their future. A good career counsellor charges a lot of money for providing such solutions. Online sources are also unreliable as information from certain sources is not always accurate. Students also do their own analysis before applying to any of the institutions, but this approach is slow and certainly not consistent with getting real results and may even involve human error. The purpose of this study is to develop a system that uses a machine learning algorithm.
